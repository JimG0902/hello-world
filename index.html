      <p>A short paragraph about myself: Born 09/02, Seattle, WA. Left Seattle when I was 
      six months old and the rest is history. Moved to Baton Rouge La., so that my father could 
      go to work for his brother. I lived in BR until I was 29 years old and moved/transferred to 
      Pittsburgh, Pa. where I stayed until June of '96. I still reside in Charlotte and want to stay 
      here.  I'm married to Pamela with whom I have a 16 year old named Campbell. Campbell is a 
      handfull and a great deal of fun and a we do a great deal of things together.  
       One interesting fact is that Pam and I are both dwarfs and our son Campbell is not.  We had 
      a twenty-five percent chance of that happening.  We are all happy that Campbell is not a dwarf, 
      only because he will not have to face the world the same way we had to.  Plus, Campbell has 
      his own set of problems, a auto-immune disease call Addisons, which cause the body's immune 
      to react too slow when a crisis hits... Even a simple cold can do him great harm.
